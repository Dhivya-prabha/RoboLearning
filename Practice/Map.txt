Map
***
Types of implementation:
1. Hash map
2. Linked Hash Map
3. TreeMap

Map is not the child interface of collection
It it not a true collection
It represent data in Key-Value pair
Duplicate keys not allowed in Map
Duplicate values are allowed


Hash Map:
**** ***
It is an implementation class of map
Java HashMap contains values based on the key.
Java HashMap contains only unique keys.
Java HashMap may have one null key and multiple null values.
Java HashMap is non synchronized.
Java HashMap maintains no order.



Abstract class:
======== ======
Abstraction is a process of hiding the implementation details and showing only functionality to the user.
An abstract class must be declared with an abstract keyword.
It can have abstract and non-abstract methods.
It cannot be instantiated.
It needs to be extended and its method implemented. 
It can have constructors and static methods also.
It can have final methods which will force the subclass not to change the body of the method.



Interface:
==========
There can be only abstract methods in the Java interface, not method body. 
It is used to achieve abstraction and multiple inheritance in Java.
Interface fields are public, static and final by default, and the methods are public and abstract.
It cannot be instantiated just like the abstract class.
we can have private, default and static methods in an interface.

An interface is declared by using the interface keyword. 
It provides total abstraction; means all the methods in an interface are declared with the empty body, and all the fields are public, static and final by default. 
A class that implements an interface must implement all the methods declared in the interface.
A class implements an interface, but one interface extends another interface.


JMS:
=====
 Java Message Service (JMS) API, a Java API that allows applications to create, send, receive, and read messages using reliable, asynchronous, loosely coupled communication.
JMS is mainly used to send and receive message from one application to another.

1) Asynchronous: To receive the message, client is not required to send request. Message will arrive automatically to the client.

2) Reliable: It provides assurance that message is delivered.


Black Box testing:
===== ===
Black box testing is the Software testing method which is used to test the software without knowing the internal structure of code or program.
Programming Knowledge is not required to carry out Black Box Testing.
Testing is applicable on higher levels of testing like System Testing, Acceptance testing.

White Box Testing:
===== === ========
White box testing is the software testing method in which internal structure is being known to tester who is going to test the software.
Programming Knowledge is required to carry out White Box Testing.
Testing is applicable on lower level of testing like Unit Testing, Integration testing.

Synchronized block vs Synchronized method:
============ ===== == ============ =======
The main difference between the synchronized method and the synchronized block is a selection of locks on which critical section is locked.

How to make a class not-inherited in java:
=== == ==== = ===== ============= == =====
Solution-1: Using final keyword
Using final keyword before a class declaration we can stop a class to be inherited by other classes.

Solution-2: By making a class constructor private:
We can also stop a class to be extended/inherited by other classes in Java by making the class constructor private.
